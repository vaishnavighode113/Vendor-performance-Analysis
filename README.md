### 💰 3. Bulk Purchasing Advantage

Bulk buying leads to massive cost savings:

| Order Size | Avg Unit Cost |
|------------|---------------|
| Small | $39.05 |
| Medium | $15.48 |
| Large | $10.78 |

➡️ **72% cost reduction** when ordering in bulk 🎯

### 📦 4. Slow-Moving Inventory

- **$2.71M worth of inventory is unsold**

This increases:
- Storage costs  
- Cash flow blockage  
- Business risk  

📌 **Recommended actions:**
- Clearance sales  
- Purchase quantity reduction  
- Inventory rationalization

### 📈 5. Profit Margin Analysis

| Vendor Type | Avg Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------------|
| Top Vendors | 31.17% |
| Low-Performing Vendors | 41.55% |

➡️ Low sellers charge more but sell less  
➡️ Top sellers sell more but at thinner margins  

📊 Statistical testing confirmed this difference is significant (95% confidence).

## 📉 Correlation Findings

| Metric Relationship | Correlation |
|--------------------|------------|
| Purchase Qty vs Sales Qty | 0.999 (Very Strong) |
| Purchase Price vs Revenue | -0.012 (Weak) |
| Profit Margin vs Sales Price | -0.179 |
| Stock Turnover vs Profit | Weak |

➡️ Selling more ≠ earning more  
➡️ Smart pricing beats increasing volume

## 🧪 Statistical Validation

We tested:

- **H₀:** Profit margins of top & low vendors are the same  
- **H₁:** Profit margins are different  

📌 **Result:** H₀ rejected → Profit models are fundamentally different
